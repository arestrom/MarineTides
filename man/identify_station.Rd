\title{Retrieve a unique station code by entering a station name}
\usage{
identify_station(station, harms = MarineTides::harmonics)
}
\arguments{
\item{station}{A character field approximating, or identical, to the tide station name}

\item{harms}{Harmonics data}
}
\value{
If a matching name is found `identify_station()` will return a unique `station_code`. This
is the official station identifier assigned by NOAA CO-OPS. If more than one partial matches
are found `identify_station()` will issue a message with a list of matching names. If no
matches are found then a message will suggest trying a different spelling.
}
\description{
Inspects `harmonics` data for stations with similar names to the \code{station}
variable. Users can enter either an exact name, or the first few letters. If an exact
match is not found, it will print a list of possible matches. If no partial matches are
found then a message will issued to retry using a different spelling.
}
\details{
The `harmonics` dataset contains information for over three thousand harmonic and subordinate
tide stations worldwide. Most stations are located in the United States, but stations are also
included for locations adjacent to USA territories in the Pacific Ocean and the Carribbean.
The `identify_station()` function uses the [data.table::%like%] function to identify stations
in the `harmonics` dataset with similar names. Unless you know the exact station name, it is
usually better to enter just the first few letters of the station name. This will return a message
in the R console with a list of possible matches.
