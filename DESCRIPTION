Description: Generates tide predictions using harmonics data obtained from the NOAA CO-OPS
    API at: https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/. Tide times and levels can be
    calculated for both primary Harmonic reference stations, as well as Subordinate stations.
    Combined, the harmonics data, and subordinate offset data, allows for predicting tides
    at 3337 locations worldwide. This includes stations adjacent to United States Pacific Ocean
    and Caribbean territories. Additional data related to annual changes in tidal gravitatonal
    forces were obtained from David Flater, creator of XTide. The code to calculate tide data
    was in part adapted from the rtide package, which in turn was derived from XTide.
